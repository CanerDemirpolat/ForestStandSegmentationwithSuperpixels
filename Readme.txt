For training data construction process, please run "construct_training_data_for_RFSLIC_and_GPRSLIC.m", you can use it in any kind of regression or classification learning

Results for the compared methods are obtained using four scripts :

1. "get_result_best_and_worst.m" -> produces segmentation results for maximum and minimum achievable performances.
2. "get_results_5methods.m" -> produces segmentation results for  GPR-SLIC, RF-SLIC, ERS-CHM, SLIC-CHM and SLIC-RGB methods.
3. "get_results_SNIC.m" -> produces segmentation results for SNIC-CHM.
4. "get_results_LSC.m" -> produces segmentation results for LSC-CHM.

Performances of above methods are graphically represented using "graphical_results.m" script.
